My name is Kacper. I'm a Developer / Software Engineer (or whatever You want to call it) focusing mostly on mobile apps. I basically love creating them, that's what drives me. I'm mostly passionate about React Native and currently working in big software house creating / maintaining IoT application in this technology.

Previously, I've worked as a Xamarin / MAUI developer but because of couple of reasons - I've switched to something more ... mature.

For reference, I love one comment about these technologies I came across some time ago while scrolling through reddit:

'If it works it works good. If it decides to not work youâ€™re in for a massive amount of headache. And sadly, it decides to not work too often.' <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dotnet/comments/15a430v/what_are_your_thoughts_about_xamarinnet_maui/">link here</a>

really true ...
